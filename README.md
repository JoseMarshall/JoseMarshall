### About Me!
I am passionate about IT :blush:, I always try to be up to date with new technologies  :computer:; it may seem strange, but I have fun when I have a problem at hand :dizzy_face: and then I solve it  have to solve it by writing code (I love it), I don't rest until there are results :chart_with_upwards_trend:. I highly value teamwork :fist:, as synergy allows combining people's strengths to more easily achieve objectives.

### My Values
- :wink: Wiling to share what I know, and admit when I dont know
- :sunglasses: Cabable of self-management
- :dizzy: Synergy is worth more than ego
- :triumph: There is no rest until the solution appears

### How I work
I always give store points to my tasks (1 to 5) this indicates an estimate of the difficulty level and how long it will take to be completed, then sort my tasks by priority (lowest to highest), Ah! and if a task is to complex, I break it down into check-lists, Trello and Jira are my best friends on doing this, but sometimes i like to write it down on paper, cuz I love the feeling in crossing out a task when it's completed!

### Tools & Skills  
Node JS | Express JS | Typescript | React JS | Next JS | Data Managment Systems (SQL Server, MongoDB,  Google Cloud Firestore) | Jest | Git | BitBucket | AWS (S3 Bucket, Simple Email Service)
